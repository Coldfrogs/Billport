# Billport
Billport aims to democratize growth for SMEs, lots of SMEs want to scale and have willing customers/markets but due to liquity issues, in fact there is an estimated 2.5 trillion dollar annual trade finance gap. The kicker, lots of recipt and verifcation data is collected but not used, we aim to change that using data to create new oppertunties.
